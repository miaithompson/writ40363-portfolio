# Project 4 Reflection: Barcelona Study Abroad Planner

## What did you build and why?

I built a Barcelona Study Abroad Planner application to help organize my upcoming semester abroad. The app features an interactive calendar that I restricted to my study dates (January 7th - April 25th), trip management with weekend trip planning, detailed itinerary planning with categories (activities, transport, housing), cost tracking, and a Barcelona spots collection for saving must-see locations in my home base, food recommendations, and activities. I needed a centralized place to plan weekend trips, track expenses throughout my semester, so building a custom app tailored to my exact dates and needs made sense for this project.

## What skills from Projects 1-3 did you upskill? How?

This project significantly expanded my JavaScript skills from previous projects. I mastered localStorage for data persistence, ensuring my trips and ideas save automatically without a backend database. Additionally, I strengthened my CSS layout skills by creating a responsive calendar grid, implementing custom form elements like styled dropdowns, and designing a cohesive color scheme with a polka dot header pattern.

## How did AI change your development process?

AI completely transformed the development of this project. Instead of spending hours debugging small issues or searching through code, I could explain what wasn't working and get immediate solutions. AI also helped me iterate on design decisions rapidly; when I decided to remove emojis for a cleaner look or switch from multiple buttons to a dropdown menu, the changes happened across HTML, CSS, and JavaScript simultaneously. This allowed me to focus on what I wanted the app to do rather than getting stuck on syntax or implementation details.

## What surprised you about working with AI?

I was surprised by how easy it was for the AI to understand what I wanted even when I asked in simple terms. I could make vague requests like "make the boxes look more cohesive" and AI understood the design direction I wanted. When something didn't work right like events not deleting properly for non-weekend trips, I could simply describe the problem in instead of debugging line by line. The most surprising aspect was how AI maintained context throughout our entire session, remembering my color preferences, font choices, and data structure decisions without me needing to re-explain everything constantly.

## What would you do differently next time?

Next time, I would plan my data structure more carefully upfront. I had to consistently change the structure of the app because I wasnt satisfied with how it looked. If I could do it again, I would draft out an idea of how I want it to look and then make it, instead of deciding as I go. I'd also establish my design preferences (colors, fonts, UI patterns) before building features, since we spent significant time removing emojis and redesigning elements I'd already implemented.

## How has your confidence as a developer changed?

My confidence has grown substantially. Previously, many features felt intimidating and beyond my skill level. Now I understand that complex applications are just collections of smaller, manageable pieces. I feel excited to build full applications rather than just simple web pages.
