# Project 4 Reflection: Barcelona Study Abroad Planner

## What did you build and why?

I built a Barcelona Study Abroad Planner application to help organize my upcoming semester abroad from January to April 2026. The app features an interactive calendar restricted to my study dates (January 7th - April 25th), trip management with weekend trip differentiation, detailed itinerary planning with categories (activities, transport, housing), itemized cost tracking, and a Barcelona spots collection for saving must-see locations, food recommendations, and activities. I needed a centralized place to plan weekend trips, track expenses, and collect ideas throughout my semester, so building a custom app tailored to my exact dates and needs made perfect sense.

## What skills from Projects 1-3 did you upskill? How?

This project significantly expanded my JavaScript skills from previous projects. I mastered localStorage for data persistence, ensuring my trips and ideas save automatically without a backend database. I improved my DOM manipulation abilities by building complex calendar rendering logic that dynamically generates dates, applies different colors for trip types, and displays event titles directly on calendar dates. My modal management skills advanced considerably—I implemented four different modals (trips, itinerary, costs, Barcelona spots) with proper event handling, form validation, and user-friendly interactions like click-outside-to-close. Additionally, I strengthened my CSS layout skills by creating a responsive calendar grid, implementing custom form elements like styled dropdowns, and designing a cohesive color scheme with a polka dot header pattern.

## How did AI change your development process?

AI completely transformed how I approached development. Instead of spending hours debugging small issues or searching Stack Overflow, I could explain what wasn't working and get immediate solutions. When I wanted to change the budget system to multiple itemized costs, AI restructured my entire data model, updated all related functions, and ensured localStorage compatibility—work that would have taken me hours to coordinate. AI also helped me iterate on design decisions rapidly; when I decided to remove emojis for a cleaner look or switch from multiple buttons to a dropdown menu, the changes happened across HTML, CSS, and JavaScript simultaneously. This allowed me to focus on what I wanted the app to do rather than getting stuck on syntax or implementation details.

## What surprised you about working with AI?

I was surprised by how conversational and iterative the process felt. I could make vague requests like "make the boxes look more cohesive" and AI understood the design direction I wanted. When something didn't work quite right—like events not deleting properly for non-weekend trips—I could simply describe the problem in plain English instead of debugging line-by-line. The most surprising aspect was how AI maintained context throughout our entire session, remembering my color preferences, font choices, and data structure decisions without me needing to re-explain everything constantly.

## What would you do differently next time?

Next time, I would plan my data structure more carefully upfront. We restructured the itinerary system early on to be trip-specific, which required refactoring. I'd also establish my design preferences (colors, fonts, UI patterns) before building features, since we spent significant time removing emojis and redesigning elements I'd already implemented. Additionally, I'd explore using AI to set up automated testing, something I didn't consider but would have caught bugs earlier.

## How has your confidence as a developer changed?

My confidence has grown substantially. Previously, ambitious features like calendar systems or modal management felt intimidating and beyond my skill level. Now I understand that complex applications are just collections of smaller, manageable pieces. I feel empowered to build full applications rather than just simple web pages. While I relied heavily on AI, I learned to articulate problems clearly, evaluate solutions critically, and understand the code being generated—skills that make me a more capable developer even without AI assistance.
