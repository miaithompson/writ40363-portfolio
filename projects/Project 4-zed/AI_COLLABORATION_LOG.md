For Project 4 I used Claude as my AI assistant. 3 things that AI taught me was
1. You have to be as descriptive as possible when putting in prompts if you want your project to be successful. 
2. I learned that they can add any font I wanted for the most part, and how I can input different fonts myself.
3. I learned how to create a polka dot background. 
There were a few times where AI got confused, and would not do what I asked even after multiple requests in different wording. Eventually, I had to completely rephrase and emphasize what I wanted, and then it would understand.
Examples of conversations we had:
1. "Can you make it to where on each weekend trip/event you can see what the title is without having to go and click it" I'll add the event titles directly on the calendar dates so you can see what's planned without clicking!
2."It wont let me go back and delete events i made if they are not weekend trips. how do i fix this?" "Good catch! Since regular events (non-weekend trips) don't show up in the trips section, you can't delete them. Let me add a way to view and manage ALL events on the calendar. I'll make it so you can click on a calendar date that has an event to see and delete it."
3. " I cant see the words "Barcelona Study abroad planner" well. How can this be fixed?" "I'll make the text more visible by adding a semi-transparent background box behind the text!"
