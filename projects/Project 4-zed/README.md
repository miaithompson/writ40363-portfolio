# Project Zed: AI-Assisted Web Application

**Course:** WRIT 40363 - Digital Communication and Design  
**Due Date:** December 10, 2025  
**Developer:** Mia Thompson

## 🎯 Project Overview

This is my final project for WRIT 40363, where I'm building an ambitious web application using AI as a development partner. The goal is to demonstrate **upskilling** — taking what I learned in Projects 1-3 and pushing beyond with AI assistance.

This project focuses on:
- Developing deeper understanding through ambitious experimentation
- Documenting the learning journey (successes, struggles, breakthroughs, and dead ends)
- Building features I wasn't confident to tackle before
- Gaining insight from both successes and failures

> **Note:** A partially-working app with deep reflection is more valuable than a perfect app without understanding. This project prioritizes growth over perfection.
