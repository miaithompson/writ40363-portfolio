#My HW3 Reflection
Confidence check: I feel fairly confident about HTML after our classes so far. I have easily stayed on track in class, but sometimes do get confused when we start moving fast.
Learning curve: I enjoyed GitHub today and thought it was really cool how quickly what you have done transfers over. I feel more secure knowing that my work is saved. 
Problem-solving Growth: This week when I encountered problems I asked the people sitting at my table, which was very heplful. 
Professional mindset: I have realized that there is much more into web page creating than just the design factor. It has opened my eyes to a new understanding of how much really goes into it, and how little I know about it. 
Week 2 reflection: My biggest "aha moment" was when I was finally able to get my file organized correctly, and was able to submit it right.
Looking forward: Looking forward, I am most nervous that I am going to fall behind and not understand concepts. I hope that I can keep up in class! 
Support and resources: So far it has been very helpful to go through everything in class, seeing what we are doing visually makes a big difference!
